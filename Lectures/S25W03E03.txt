so I was trying to figure out how
difficult is it uh to write this simple
app for multiple
countries um so different currency sign
um so in um in
Germany 100 EUR I would uh and I
actually don't know if I can get the
Euro sign here oh actually let's see uh
symbols
here we
go so it would say I think like this um
it would say it like this uh so first of
all so in in the US obviously it would
be like
this okay so the dollar sign is in front
the Euro sign is behind and then what's
going on here so um some countries and
Germany is not the only one uh use
commas to separate the fraction from the
from the main number um so now you you
don't just have to know what is the
symbol for that country you now also
have to know how do they deal with the
comma or the the sorry the the decimal
place uh so it's starting to grow in
complexity uh so formatting things so
currency
uh dates uh are the same so like so in
the US I I'm assuming if I write this as
a date um so
uh so what what date is
this 11th of February okay uh what date
is
this oh uh what what dat is
this second of November yes uh so uh
some countries do uh their dates their
day and month differently um so whenever
you're tempted to and and time too can
be weird uh units whenever you're
attempted to write your own code for
formatting
um
currencies um
dates anything that can be
complicated uh please don't there are
tools um for you to for for you to uh
use uh so yeah how do we how do we do
this so we we do this in an in an old
way that you might still see in in a new
way so um we have something called a
number
formatter and then we set
and here I need the what do I
set uh number
style to
currency and then the
format can give us a string from and
then this is here we're seeing how old
uh this is so if we have the total tip
we have to say we want it as n as number
oh uh and
then this returns an optional which uh I
actually have
never oh no actually yeah I've never um
had this return
not what I wanted and then we can
assign this okay all right let's see
what this does I think I have honored
that right yep okay
all right let's type in
100 calculate and uh so as you can see I
didn't hard code the dollar sign I
didn't say use the period for decimal
place I didn't say give me two decimal
places um it just does it all uh if I
now go into my phone setting and I
change my um my area uh my um so it
doesn't solve it for if I'm traveling so
if I'm traveling my phone will likely
still be in the same uh in the same uh
area uh sorry in the same what what are
they called they're called um say again
uh region yeah so region settings I
guess region settings this yeah I forget
maybe maybe that's it but yeah so I'm
I'm not like I'm not going to change my
my phone's internal currency if I'm
traveling but this solves the problem
for someone in Germany downloading this
app and it showing the correct uh
currency here so uh so yeah this is one
way um we're dealing with something NS
which means this is objective c so the
number formatter uh was written multiple
decades ago likely
um but yeah you might still see this uh
more
modern way to do this and much easier
to
um uh yeah much easier so we can say uh
output oh sorry where's our total
tip format it and then we can pass in
the format
currency um here we would be able to
type in a currency code if we wanted to
so you this dollar would give us the
dollar sign and um the period and two
decimal places but then again this
wouldn't quite solve our
problem uh for our app being downloaded
in another country so instead and I need
my notes Here one second we can type
in
ah uh so there's the phones
local which means um these are all of
the region settings uh so what kind of a
currency you want to
display what kind of a
um uh what symbol to use for temperature
so that's that's all in there how what
date format so we want the current one
of those and then we want
currency and we want the
identifier and then so I'm going to do
something here that I we'll explain a
little bit
later uh and then so this is the
slightly more Modern Way for currency
it's a little awkward and we're going to
see this um the same way of formatting
something uh for the percent in a second
that is not quite as
awkward so this also should give us the
dollar all right $20
uh all right um I think I owe you guys
another break uh so maybe let's make
this one slightly shorter let's come
back at uh
920 and then uh
